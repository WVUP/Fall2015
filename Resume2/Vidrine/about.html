		and I come out of Ripley, WV. I indulge in the art of blowing minds with my guitar shredding powers given to me by Jesus. Im basically amphibious cause I can play both left handed guitars and right handed guitars no problem. The fact remains that I'm probably the best guitarist I know of. I had an opportunity to sign with Metal Blade records back in December but I had to turn it down because of a pinky toe injury from skateboarding, making me incapable of playing guitar for a few weeks. A lot of artists think that to have a good album means good recordings, but I like to use crappy home recordings. It really brings out the flavor in the song if you know what I mean. I pretty much know everything there is to know about playing guitars and any other instrument that exists for that matter. If you need lessons, you'll have to wait a while because I'm currently teaching Chuck Norris how to master sweep arpeggios and speed picking techniques. Okay see ya later, and don't forget to peep my songs!
